<p><i>Ineteresting facts about camels</i></p>
<p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
<p> Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</p>
<p> Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</p>

<div class=one>
<p><i>Ineteresting facts about pigeons</i></p>
<p>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>
<p> Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.</p>
<p>   Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc.</p>

<div class=one>
<p><i>Ineteresting facts about bears</i></p> 
<p>Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.</p>
<p> Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees. They can use these for hiding, eating and even sleeping.</p>
<p> Bears care deeply about family members. They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger.</p>

<div class=one>
<p><i>Ineteresting facts about pandas</i></p>
<p>Pandas eat consistently for 12-14 hours a day.</p>  
<p> Adult panda bears can weigh as much as 45 kilos (100 pounds).</p>  
<p>Like other bears, pandas can swim! They do not, however, hibernate, as they are unable to store energy over long periods of time</p>

<div class=one>
<p><i>Ineteresting facts about flying cicadas</i></p>
<p> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</p>
    <p>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</p>
<p>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</p>
